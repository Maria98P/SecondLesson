<h1> Choose your own adventure!</h1>
<div>
    The most dangerous moment in any story is the beginning.
    As the story opens, every ending is equally possible, every path unwalked, every question not only unanswered, but unasked.
    The unread story is infinite possibility. Yet the ending is already written, and though you be clever, though you be brave, there is no outwitting it.
    Are you brave enough to begin? If so, turn to page 1. If not, remain safe. Close this page. No one will think any less of you.
