Page 89: You’ve been reading the alternate endings, haven’t you? Of course I know. I know everything that happens in all of the stories I hold.
Did you think I wouldn’t notice that you’re cheating?
Do you not understand that stories have rules?
You feel a pulling, and then are buffeted by a whirlwind. You hear something tear, feel a page come loose from your bindings.
You find yourself back at the beginning, holding a book.
You open the cover. Once upon a time.
