    <h1> A fairytale </h1>
    <hr>
    <h4> What is this story about? </h4>
    <br>
    <p> The story of Cinderella tells of a kindhearted young woman who was treated cruelly by her stepmother and sisters, 
    but, never the less, kept a humble attitude.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4> How it all began?</h4>
    <br>
    <p> One day, the king decided to throw a ball and invited all the young maidens in the kingdom. 
    While Cinderella’s sisters made her help them get ready for the ball, 
    not once did they ask her if she would like to go with them.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4> What happened next?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
    Once they left, her Fairy Godmother appeared and helped Cinderella go to the ball with a bit of magic 
    that would only last until midnight. At the ball, Cinderella caught the eye of the prince, 
    as she was the most beautiful girl there, and they danced all night.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4> And then?</h4>
    <br>
    <p>When midnight came, Cinderella had to leave the ball, 
    and in her hurry, one of her glass slippers fell off her feet. 
    The prince found this slipper and vowed to marry the girl who the slipper belonged to.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4> A happy end</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The prince went from house to house, looking for the girl who’s foot fit the slipper, 
    and he reached Cinderella’s house. Though Cinderella’s stepsisters and stepmother tried to keep her from trying it on, 
    the glass slipper was a perfect fit, and she was soon married to the prince and lived happily ever after.
